      "message": "Just thinking out loud, but it looks to me like the general approach here is to send the max number of objects, ignoring failures. In which case is there a way we can throw this at the end rather than in here? That might allow more objects to be sent across. Downside might be code complexity (I haven\u0027t written it out), but I thought it\u0027s worth asking the question.",
