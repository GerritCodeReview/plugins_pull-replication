      "message": "@Marcin, the thing is that it is not called `uri` and changing that will be another core plugin replication change.\n\nRenaming fields is a different exercise than just making the replication events to inherit from a parent: it\u0027d require to deprecate the fields, add additional ones, and then remove them.\n\nInheriting from a common parent was the minimal change we needed to move forward with this and that\u0027s why I took that direction in [1]\n\nIf you feel strongly about this, we should block this CR again and make another (possibly long) in replication plugin.\n\nWDYT?\n\n\n[1]https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/replication/+/312802",
