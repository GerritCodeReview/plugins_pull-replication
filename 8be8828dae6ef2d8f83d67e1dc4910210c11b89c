Then this assertion would still be satisfied, which honestly is a test error, because the code isn\u0027t working and the test is passing.\n\nI believe we need to:\n- Assert that once the event is triggered after L180, the healthcheck should fail\n- waitUntil the replication has finished\n- Assert that after the replication has finished, the healthcheck should pass",
