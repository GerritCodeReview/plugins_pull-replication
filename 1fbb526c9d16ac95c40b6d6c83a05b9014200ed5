      "message": "After discussing this offline, it turned out that this change will change how the `replication` plugin behaves, **but** this is a rare corner case, let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, you need to have **both** `replication` and `pull-replication` plugins installed at the same time. Both would use `$gerrit_site/etc/replication.config` file to get the remote configuration. Let\u0027s assume that we have a remote configured as follows:\n```\n[remote \"backup\"]\n  url: https://gerrit@backup.system.com/\n  apiUrl: https://backup.system.com/\n  fetch: refs/*:refs/*\n```\nthe `replication` plugin would discover that this is a `push-replication` remote and will completely ignore it.\nNow, **assuming** this change is merged, The configuration can be updated to:\n```\n[remote \"backup\"]\n  url: https://gerrit@backup.system.com/\n  apiUrl: https://backup.system.com/\n```\nThis means, that the `replication` plugin will recognize it as a valid remote, it will assume the default `push` configuration as `refs/*:refs/*`. And will start pushing updates to it.\n\nI can see three possible solutions for this:\n1. document this behaviour, put it into release notes and emit a warning when it\u0027s detected - IMO this is the least user-friendly, as it requires user action and also assumes that someone will have a look at logs/changelog/documentation.\n2. in the `replication` plugin check for `apiUrl` and ignore such remote - the downside is that the `replication` plugin will become _aware_ of the `pull-replication` which from the design perspective may not be desired\n3. declare this issue as _won\u0027t fix_ as the fix affects the `replication` plugin\n\nI\u0027m leaning more toward #2 or #3, solutions.

      "message": "We want to avoid adding `fetch` in replicas, as documented in Issue 40015281, isn\u0027t it?\n\nReplicas do not support the replication plugin, because they would never ever accept any updates.\n\nThe scenario therefore where we do not have `fetch` (replicas) and the replication plugin things this is a push target just does not exist.\n\n@syntonyze@gmail.com do you see any other gothas?",
