I don\u0027t think we need to transform it back into a list in order to have a for-loop, we can `map` and transform the resulting stream into the linked list (or just populate `blobs`).",

Won\u0027t read great but will be more efficient. \n\nI am planning to raise a separate commit where the filter and foreach is done within the stream, which will be efficient enough. I just didnt do it here as it could be considered refactoring (and hence needs a separate commit).",
