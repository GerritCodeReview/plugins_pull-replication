      "message": "\u003e Wouldn\u0027t this give a false perception that replication works fine? \n\nIt actually works fine: sync replication is a \"wish\" rather than a \"requirement\"\n\n\u003e Users do use the sync replication for a reason. Secretly switching to async replication doesn\u0027t feel good.\n\nWell, replication is an _eventually consistent_ strategy to align different sites. Synchronous replication is for minimising the split-brain alerts and lock errors, but it may fail.\n\nYou should never assume that all sites are always up-to-date and always responding quicklu.\n\n\u003e What will happen when the sync replication is constantly failing? Will we build up a backlog of async replications in the background?\n\nThat\u0027s not different on what happens when a site is down: the replication events will be queued and eventually executed.\n\n\u003e IMO we should at least log a warning and possibly have a configuration option to enable fallback to async replication.\n\nYou should never ever disable the fallback, so a config option would be a mistake IMHO. A warning isn\u0027t needed because the failure of the apply object is already flagged in the logs.",
