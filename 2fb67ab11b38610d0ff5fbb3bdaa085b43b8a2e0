      "message": "The change itself LGTM, but I am a bit confused about the separation of responsibilities between pull-replication, high-availability, multi-site.\n\nWith this issue (but also with others in the past addressing indexing), looks like the direction is to make pull-replication smarter and smarter.\n\nWhilst I can see why this is useful in some context, it blurs the line between replicating git-data (*replication plugins) and keeping Gerrit up-to-date (multi-site, high-availability plugins).\n\nIf updating Gerrit (index, cache) becomes a responsibility of pull-replication, then what distinguishes it from the responsibilities of multi-site and high-availability?\n\nIf pull-replication is now responsible for keeping indexes and caches up-to-date, then should we not keep them *all* up-to-date, rather than just an arbitrary subset of them (like in this cache sshkeys)? \n\nWhat happens when pull-replication is used together with multi-site, for example? wouldn\u0027t all these operations be executed twice? Even if they are idempotent, surely that\u0027s a waste of resources.\n\nPerhaps these concerns are already obvious to some of you, so I apologise in advance, but I could do with a discussion and formalization of those boundaries?\n\n@luca.milanesio@gmail.com, @ponch78@gmail.com, @maczech@gmail.com, WDYT?",

Even if they are idempotent, surely that\u0027s a waste of resources.\n\nWe probably need an overall configuration to tell us when the pull replication is working in _standalone_. We could use it to decide whether or not it has to rely on other plugins to keep up with the other nodes. _Keep up_ probably means evicting caches, indexing and consuming events from the broker. Anything else?\n\nHappy to have a chat about it and maybe formalise it in the documentation as well.",
