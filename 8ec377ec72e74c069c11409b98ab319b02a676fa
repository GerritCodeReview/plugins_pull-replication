      "message": "It LGTM, I just want to ensure I understand this correctly. The `/meta` will be replicated at some point by a fetch. This means we might end up with the latest patchset being replicated but not with the last `/meta`, which is better than the contrary, which would lead to the list of issues you mentioned\n\nThis would work for busy repositories since at some point a fetch will bring in the latest `/meta`, correct?\n\nI wonder if it makes sense, maybe as a follow up if this is not enough, to add a retry mechanism to see if the PS at some point has been fetched before giving up. I guess it really depends on the profile of the traffic, since, depending on how long the fetches normally take, the retry might not be effective.",
