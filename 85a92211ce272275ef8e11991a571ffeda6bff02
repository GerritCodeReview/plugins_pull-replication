      "message": "\u003e It is very confusing that there are 2 layers of delay;\n\u003e - One when scheduling the runnable (L65)\n\nYes, that is always set to zero when invoked from the SSH command (see StartFetchCommand.java:83), so you can assume it is scheduled immediately.\n\n\u003e - One when the runnable schedules the replication task (L88 \u0026 L90).\n\nYes, that must be the delay configured in the replication.config, unless you specify `--now` in the SSH command.\n\n\u003e Is this necessary?\n\nYes, those are two different things for two different purposes. We can of course refactor the code on master.",
