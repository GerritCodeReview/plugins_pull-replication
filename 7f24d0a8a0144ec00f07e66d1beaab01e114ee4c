      "message": "The first impression is that this change is way too big.\n\nIMHO we should break this down into different parts:\n\n1. Abstract the FetchOne to a generic \u0027ReplicationRunnable\u0027 which has these method associated:\n\n```\npublic interface ReplicationRunnable extends Runnable {\n\tURIish getURI();\n\tboolean wasCanceled();\n\tboolean isRetrying();\n\tObject getRefs();\n\tvoid addRefs(Object refs);\n\tObject getTaskIdHex();\n\tvoid canceledByReplication();\n\tboolean setToRetry();\n}\n```\n\n2. Extract from FetchOne a RetryingReplicationOp that implements the ReplicationRunnable retrying logic\n\n3. Introduce a new DeleteOne which derive from RetryingReplicationOp\n\n4. Trigger a DeleteOne or a FetchOne depending on the type of input operation\n\nThe individual changes should be more self-contained, focused and smaller to review and merge.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "hey @luca.milanesio@gmail.com I would like to start addressing this comment but I\u0027m a bit confused. [Here](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/pull-replication/+/390981/comments/f18246ad_0df230e4) you mentioned that we have to separate refactoring from features. Is it fine to do this refactoring as a part of this ticket? Also in the change I already mentioned you are fine with passing boolean flag and here you are suggesting to avoid it.",
