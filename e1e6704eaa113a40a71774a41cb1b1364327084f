      "message": "I think this is the right approach @Alvaro, well done üëç\nThe only thing I am still thinking about is this cache value as `boolean`:\n\nI think it is misleading.\nWhat would it mean for the cache to have a `false` value?\n\nIdeally, this would be a set rather than a map, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any class modelling a set with TTL:\n\nA couple of alternatives could be:\n- use the key _as_ the value.\n- use a DUMMY static value.\n\nWDYT?",
