      "message": "How has this been tested? I am worried that L532-533 may not be not enough, because FetchOne keeps some state in the `stateMap` variable and based on this state it keeps track of what is completed (see the `ReplicationState.notifyRefReplicated`) - we might need a call to `e.addState(...)` as well. Not sure if this is a problem here but it might be when we are dealing with multiple refs.\n\nAnother question, what is happening with metrics? I think this change stops tracking counters like the fetch task count etc?",
