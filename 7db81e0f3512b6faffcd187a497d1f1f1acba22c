      "message": "Hi Dalio, thank you for your contribution to the pull-replication.\nI will try to reproduce the issue and validate your fix. My understanding was that when we create a new project, on replica nodes we create empty repository and then we trigger git fetch operation for all refs[1]. We do that to make sure that all refs from the primary node and synced up on replica node. Could you please check if that fetch is successful and if you still see the issue with the repo clone\n\n1. https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/pull-replication/+/refs/heads/stable-3.7/src/main/java/com/googlesource/gerrit/plugins/replication/pull/ReplicationQueue.java?autodive\u003d0%2F#494",
