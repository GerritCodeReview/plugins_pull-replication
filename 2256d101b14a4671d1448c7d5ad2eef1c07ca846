      "message": "We should move `filteredRefsBatch`, `apiTimer` `batchApplyObjectStr`, `uri` into this branch as they are not used in the else branch anymore. Technically the latter two are also used in the log statement above... but maybe it would be clearer if that log statement was moved into this branch, and we added another log statement to say we\u0027re falling back as `enableBatchedRefs` isn\u0027t set. WDYT? Or maybe this is addressed in another change in this chain?",

      "message": "Ah yes, my bad - we shouldn\u0027t have it in the loop. We are still calling these methods unnecessary though if we end up in the `else` branch though. Maybe they\u0027re cheap and we don\u0027t care too much, in which case this works; otherwise we could assign these to private methods, so we would only evaluate them in the branch they\u0027re required. Either works for me.\n\nI like the different log lines - I think it\u0027ll be easier to follow what\u0027s happening ðŸ˜Š",
