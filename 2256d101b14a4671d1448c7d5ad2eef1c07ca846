      "message": "We should move `filteredRefsBatch`, `apiTimer` `batchApplyObjectStr`, `uri` into this branch as they are not used in the else branch anymore. Technically the latter two are also used in the log statement above... but maybe it would be clearer if that log statement was moved into this branch, and we added another log statement to say we\u0027re falling back as `enableBatchedRefs` isn\u0027t set. WDYT? Or maybe this is addressed in another change in this chain?",
