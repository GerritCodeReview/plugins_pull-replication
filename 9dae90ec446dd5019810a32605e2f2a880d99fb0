      "message": "It\u0027s not necessary, it\u0027s just some code hygiene. It only touches test code, introduced as part of adding the mirror functionality (both JGit and CGit), so I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll cause us particular headaches.\n\nIf the JGit/CGit mirror functionality had been done in the same change, I think this would naturally have been part of that change, however as we split them we end up with some unnecessarily duplicated code.\n\nHaving said that I think I\u0027m going to squash this into the CGit client work, I think it probably belongs in there.",
